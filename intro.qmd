# Introduction

This handbook is designed to provide an overview of different data types, tools,
and practices to be used when working with the Adaptation Atlas ecosystem of
tools and data. It can also be a useful guide for other projects as it describes
the use of data on AWS S3 buckets, efficient use of cloud-optimized datasets, 
and notes on some best practices for data management.
