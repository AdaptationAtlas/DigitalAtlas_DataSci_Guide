# The Agricultural Adaptation Data naming conventions

<!-- ## Why?
It may be easy to overlook the importance of naming conventions, especially when the data is already -->

Naming formats should be as consistent as possible, especially across similar data sets and directories. For example:
```
    {SCENARIO}_{DATE}_{MODEL}_{VARIABLE}_{aggregation_fn}.extension
```

The naming format used should be stored within the metadata for the data.

In general: 

- Underscores ("_") should be used to seperate metadata chunks
- Hyphens/Dashes ("-") should be used to separate dates, date ranges and other pieces of information that are in the same group.
- Forward slashes ("/") should be used to separate directories
- Periods/Full Stops (".") should only be used before a file extension
- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format or YYYY

This is a selection of naming conventions used across atlas data:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: false
read.csv("namingScheme.csv", na.strings = "NA") 
```
