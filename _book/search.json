The example below shows how to build a very basic STAC catalog using pystac.\n\nproductivity_catalog = pystac.Catalog( \n  id=\"crop_productivity_data\",\n  description=\"Modelled data of crop productivity\",\n  title=\"Crop Productivity\"\n  )\n\n\n\n5.1.2 STAC collections\nSTAC collections are very similar to STAC catalogs, except they have extra metadata such as a spatio-temporal extent, keywords, custom fields, and STAC extensions which are explained in more detail in the STAC extension heading. They are a bit more difficult to build due to this extra metadata, but the general process is below.\n\n# Build the temporal extent of the collection\n# the strptime function takes a string time and the format it is in such as %Y-%M-%d\n# STAC requires the time to be in UTC, so the replace function forces it into that format\n# NOTE: that this method will default to YEAR-01-01 if the month and day aren't provided/NA\ntime = ['2000', '2030']\nstart = str(dt.datetime.strptime(time[0], '%Y').replace(tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc))\nend = str(dt.datetime.strptime(time[1], '%Y').replace(tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc))\n\n# Build the spatial extent of the collection\n# The bounds can be calculated using the riostac package, rasterio, terra, etc. \nbounds = {'xmin': -180, 'ymin': -90, 'xmax': 180, 'ymax': 90}\nbbox = [bounds['xmin'], bounds['ymin'], bounds['xmax'], bounds['ymax']]\n\n# And now put the whole catalog together\nproductivity_paper_collection = pystac.Collection(id = \"paper1_data\",\n    description = \"data from paper by Todd\",\n    keywords = \"productivity\", \"maize\", \"rice\", \"treated\", \"adaptation\"\n    license = \"CC-BY-4.0\",\n    extent = pystac.Extent(\n        spatial = pystac.SpatialExtent(bboxes=[bbox]),\n        temporal = pystac.TemporalExtent(\n            intervals=[\n            start,\n            end\n            ]\n        )\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n5.1.3 STAC items\n\n# In this example the bbox of the item is the same as the collection,\n# but this is not always the case\nbounds = {'xmin': -180, 'ymin': -90, 'xmax': 180, 'ymax': 90}\nbbox = [bounds['xmin'], bounds['ymin'], bounds['xmax'], bounds['ymax']]\nfootprint = shapely.Polygon([\n            [bounds['xmin'], bounds['ymin']],\n            [bounds['xmin'], bounds['ymax']],\n            [bounds['xmax'], bounds['ymax']],\n            [bounds['xmax'], bounds['ymin']]\n        ])\n\n# Now we set the date of the item\n# we could use 'strptime()' agin if date is a charachter, or set it like this:\ndata_date = dt.datetime(2020, 2, 5).replace(tzinfo=dt.timezone.utc)\n\nitem = pystac.Item(id='maize_productivity.tif',\n                      geometry=footprint,\n                      bbox=bbox,\n                      datetime=data_date, #Can be set to `None` if multiple dates\n                      #start_datetime=start_date, #Optional if multiple dates\n                      #end_datetime=end_date, \n                      properties={\n                          'extraMetadataField': 'value',\n                          'extraMetadataField2': 'value2',\n                          \"unit\": \"kg/ha\",\n                          \"ssp\": \"SSP2-4.5\"\n                      })\n\nMost often there will be more than one item in a collection. It is often useful to wrap the above code into a for loop and append each item to a list of items. ### STAC assets This is the final piece of the STAC spec. An asset holds the paths to the STAC Item, other data, derived datasets, and other useful assets. It offers a lot of flexibility, you can have a single asset for each date, a different asset for each model or crop, etc. depending on what fits best with the data.\n\nasset = pystac.Asset(href=\"s3://bucket/maize_productivity.tif\", \n                     media_type=pystac.MediaType.COG)\nitem.add_asset(\"COG Image\", asset)\n\n# or for multiple\ns3_uris = [\n    \"s3://bucket/maize_productivity_2020-1.tif\",\n    \"s3://bucket/maize_productivity_2020-2.tif\",\n    \"s3://bucket/maize_productivity_2020-3.tif\"\n    ]\n\nfor uri in s3_uris:\n    asset = pystac.Asset(href=uri, media_type=pystac.MediaType.COG)\n    asset_time = uri.split(\"_\")[-1] # get the filename \n    asset_name = f'maize productivity cog {asset_time}'\n    item.add_asset(asset_name, asset)\n\n\n\n5.1.4 STAC extensions\nSTAC extensions can be added to all of the STAC specifications - catalogs, collections, items, and assets. These extensions provide a more formal metadata framework for certain types/aspects of metadata (i.e. raster, projection, or data cube specific metadata).\n\nproj = pystac.extensions.ProjectionExtension.ext(item, add_if_missing=True) #add to the item\n\nproj.apply(epsg=4326)\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Combining them all into a final catalog\n\n# add the item to the collection\nproductivity_paper_collection.add_item(item)\n# use .add_items() if you have multiple items in a list \n\n# Add the collection to the catalog\nproductivity_catalog.add_child(productivity_paper_collection)\n\n# Now just save it\nproductivity_catalog.normalize_and_save(\"~/stac/\", catalog_type=pystac.CatalogType.SELF_CONTAINED)"
